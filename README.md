### The Problem It Solves
Standard browsers (Chrome, Opera, Firefox) frequently fail on restricted college WiFi due to firewall policies, bandwidth limits, and security blocks — leading to endless IT complaints from students.  

**CollegeSecure Browser** changes that:
- Works **only** when connected to your college network/server
- Provides seamless, frustration-free browsing for students
- Gives department heads (HODs) private, non-intrusive activity monitoring (invisible to students)

Built over **2+ years** by a solo 19-year-old developer who refused to give up despite zero support, multiple restarts, and constant doubt.

### Key Features
- **Campus WiFi Lock** — Automatically detects and enforces college network only
- **Private HOD Monitoring Dashboard** — See visited sites, time spent, tabs (no student visibility)
- **Familiar Browser Experience** — Multi-tab support, address bar, bookmarks, history
- **Custom Dashboard/Home Page** — Quick links to college portal, LMS, Coding Pro, job portals, etc.
- **Secure & Lightweight** — Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), small installer size
- **Privacy Focused** — No external tracking, data stays on your institution's server
- **Extensible** — Easy to add themes, extensions, or integrations

### Why This Matters
This is more than a browser — it's a **statement**.  
Proof that one determined student can build something no Indian college has ever deployed before: **its own secure, purpose-built browser**.

### Target Users
- Colleges & Universities (reduce IT support tickets by 30–50%)
- Coding & EdTech Platforms (e.g., Coding Pro with 10k+ users)
- Departments needing controlled, auditable browsing

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: React / Next.js (generated via OpenBuilder AI)
- Desktop Wrapper: Electron (MVP) → planning Tauri migration for lighter builds
- Core: WebView + custom network detection & monitoring logic

### Current Status (January 2026)
- 80–85% complete
- Ready for internal pilot testing (1-month free trial planned)
- Seeking first college partner (starting with my own institution)
